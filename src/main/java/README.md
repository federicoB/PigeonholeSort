### Project structure

The project has 2 packages:
* algorithm: contains the abstract PigeonholeSort class that provides polymorphic methods for sorting.
* visualization: set of classes to create the javaFx application that displays the execution of the algorithm.

The pigeonholeSort class is not used directly in visualization but the sorting method is the same.
